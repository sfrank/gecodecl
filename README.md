# Overview

GecodeCL is a Common Lisp interface to the Gecode constraint solver
library.

+ the interface is for the upcoming Gecode 4.0 release
  (earlier versions will not work!)
+ GecodeCL is in an early stage so expect changes in the interface
+ there is currently no documentation; refer to the examples which
  will be expanded as development moves along 


# Roadmap

The next development steps will be (in no particular order)

+ expand the low-level interface to cover more Gecode functionality
+ develop the modelling interface
+ incorporate the symbolic expression simplifier
+ expand examples
