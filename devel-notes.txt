Some design decisions(-) and TODOs(*) to support my memory later
(in time lined order of occurrence):

- FFI functions keep their C level name to serve as a clear marker
  since a Lisp abstraction for normal use is provided (and is the
  only sane way to use anyway). 

* The current solution for exeception catching works only for
  non-treaded uses. If a new (C side) thread is created (as is
  e.g. possible during parallel solution search) and causes an
  exception it will not appear on the Lisp side. Explore, how others
  solved this (maybe create an initial thread to set up the exception
  handling machinery?)
