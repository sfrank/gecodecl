Some design decisions(-) and TODOs(*) to support my memory later
(in time lined order of occurrence):

- FFI functions keep their C level name to serve as a clear marker
  since a Lisp abstraction for normal use is provided (and is the
  only sane way to use anyway). 

* The currently solution for exeception catching works only for
  non-treaded uses. If a new thread is created and causes an
  exception it will not appear on the Lisp side. Explore how
  others solved this (maybe create an initial thread to set up
  the exception handling machinery?)
